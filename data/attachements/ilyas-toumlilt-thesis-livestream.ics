DESCRIPTION:\nIt is my pleasure to invite you to the livestream of my th
 esis defense\,\n           completed within the LIP6 Delys INRIA team an
 d titled "Colony: A Hybrid Consistency System for Highly-Available Colla
 borative Edge Computing".\n\n           The defense will be in english a
 nd take place on Tuesday\, Decembre 21\, 2021 at 13:00 (Paris Time).\n\n

 nEdge applications\, such as gaming\, cooperative engineering\, or in-th
 e-field information sharing\, enjoy immediate response\, autonomy and av
 ailability by distributing and replicating data at the edge. However\, a
 pplication developers and users demand the highest possible consistency 
 guarantees\, and specific support for group collaboration. To address th
 is challenge\, Colony guarantees Transactional Causal Plus Consistency (
 TCC+) globally\, strengthened to Snapshot Isolation within edge groups. 
 To help with scalability\, fault tolerance and security\, its logical co
 mmunication topology is forest-like\, with replicated roots in the core 
 cloud\, but with the flexibility to migrate a node or a group. Despite t
 his hybrid approach\, applications enjoy the same semantics everywhere i
 n the topology. Our experiments show that local caching and peer groups 
 improve throughput and response time significantly\, performance is not 
 affected in offline mode\, and that migration is seamless.
