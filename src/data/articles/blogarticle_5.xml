            This demo app shows a collaborative application developed using a draft implementation of the Concordant API. The application uses the C-Service API which currently supports two eventual consistency backends: revision-based and CRDT-based. This demo shows that with a revision based approach, the user loses updates, either if updates are executed concurrently online, or if multiple users edit the document offline. To have an adequate semantics, the user needs to provide custom, non-trivial, code to merge the updates executed by each user. With the CRDT-based backend, update convergence is available out-of-the-box.
        </p>

            The current demo is implemented on top of PouchDB which offers replication and offline support. Later we will implement our backed without any third-party dependencies.
